[![Tuenti Challenge
3](https://contest.tuenti.net/resources/logo.png)](https://contest.tuenti.net/)

Here are my (Gorat) solutions for all problems but 11th (puto George), for
http://contest.tuenti.net.

Had a great time solving them, hope someone finds them useful.

These might not be the final solution submitted since I deleted some sidework
by accident, but they are all compilable at least.

#### To run these solutions, you'll need:
* C++, CMake (bulk)
* Python
* Bash
